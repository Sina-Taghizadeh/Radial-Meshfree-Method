# Radial Basis Function Interpolation

## Introduction
This project explores the use of Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation as a meshfree method for solving partial differential equations. RBF methods offer an alternative to traditional mesh-based methods, such as the finite element method, by eliminating the need for a mesh.

## Methodology
* **Meshfree Methods:** Meshfree methods use a scattered set of nodes to approximate the solution, avoiding the need for a mesh.
* **Radial Basis Functions:** RBFs are radial symmetric functions centered at each node. They are used to construct shape functions for interpolation.
* **RBF Interpolation:** The RBF interpolation process involves:
  * Selecting a set of nodes.
  * Choosing an RBF.
  * Solving a linear system to determine the coefficients of the shape functions.
